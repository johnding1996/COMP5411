  Abstract                 = {For pt.1 see ibid., previous issue. Soap bubbles are fragile, beautiful phenomena. They're fun to make and play with, and their geometry is as clean and elegant as anything in nature, which makes them particularly suited to computer graphics. In pt.1 I discussed the nature of soap films. These thin sheets of soapy water have less surface tension than water itself, so they can billow out into curved surfaces like bubbles. In this part I talk about where a bubble's beautiful colors come from, the geometry of bubble clusters, and how to make bubbles in a 3D modeler},

  Abstract                 = {In the field of computer graphics, simulation of physical phenomena is of great interest. We focus on the optical effects of soap bubbles. Soap bubbles have fascinating coloration and interesting physical properties. Therefore they are useful for the entertainment such as movies and games. Soap bubbles change their shapes by surface tension and external forces, and therefore their surface thickness also changes. Since the thickness of the soap bubble is several hundred nanometers, interference of the light occurs. This paper proposes a fast rendering method for the soap bubbles taking into account light interference and dynamics. In our method, the reflectivities of the thin film that is the cause of the light interference are calculated in advance and stored as textures. This makes it possible to render the de-formable soap bubbles in real-time},
